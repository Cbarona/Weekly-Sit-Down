# Weekly-Sit-Down

A semi casual version of a Daily Standup 

## The purpose of a Weekly Sit Down
This is an informal meeting amongst colleagues typically to be held at the beginning of the week. A weekly sit down can hold many benefits like reflecting on the prior week and being mindful about how you would want to approach the current week; it even serves as a moment to network  with your own peers.

## How to Host a Weekly Sit Down
There is no right or wrong way to host a weekly sit down meeting. Here is a general guideline to host a sit down.

1. ### In a group of no more than five people, schedule 30-40 minutes on the same day and time every week for a cycle of 4-5 weeks.
       Put it on the calendar and make sure all attendees are aware of the meeting.


1. ### Delegate a different person as the meeting leader every week.
       Choosing a different person to take lead every week will allow for a fluid line of communication, 
       giving everyone an active role.


1. ### Bring your favorite work appropriate beverage.
       The first thing each person does when it's their turn to speak is to mindfully
       describe what they are drinking. 
       Is your drink hot or cold? What color is it? Where did you get it? 
       If it's the same beverage as last week you, can simply state that or go further into detail about it.


1. ### Similar to a Daily Stand Up, go through the three typical questions but scaled up by a week. Reflect on what you are sharing and feel free to take up to five minutes if you feel the need.
       What have I done in the last week?
       What will I do this week?
       What obstacles are keeping me from reaching my goals this week?
       You can even choose to ask for feedback and insight.

1. ### At the end of each 4-5 week cycle, dissolve the group, form a new one and repeat steps 1 through 4.
       Changing groups at the end of every cycle will keep things dynamic, 
       always keep in mind that this serves as an informal networking 
       exercise to promote growth and to learn about what your peers are working on.
